Today we will discuss the standard template library for C++.  You don't have to use this for your own
programming, but we will use it in our examples so you should know how it all works.

We will cover:
 - C-Style arrays
 - Vectors
 - Pairs
 - Stacks and Queues
 - Maps and Sets


We will not cover =priority_queue=, but you may want to look at those as well on your own.
