The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming technique used in competitive programming to find the shortest
paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted, directed graph. Unlike Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford's algorithms,
which focus on single-source shortest paths, Floyd-Warshall efficiently computes the shortest paths for every vertex
pair simultaneously.  Due to its \\(O(V^3)\\) time complexity, it's best suited for graphs with a relatively small number of
vertices, typically when $ V &le; 400 $ in most competitive scenarios.
