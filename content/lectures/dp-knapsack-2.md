The Knapsack problem is famous.  How to fill a sack with items that are of maximal value without breaking the sack?

Last class we discussed how to do this using a classic algorithm.  This time we will combine dynamic programming with
divide and conquer to make a truly fast version that can solve knapsack with repetitions.
